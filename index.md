<h2> Cloud Computing </h2>
Familiar with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I have worked with cloud technologies to deploy and manage applications in the cloud.

<br>
<h2> Operating Systems and Networking </h2>
I’ve developed programs in C using vim and gained hands-on experience in socket programming (both UDP and TCP) while learning how networks and the internet operate.

<br>
<h2> Team Projects </h2>
In a group project, I collaborated using Scrum and Agile methodologies to build a studyBuddy app with features like a calendar, task scheduling, flashcards, and a priority queue. We used JavaFX for the development of the project, aiming to simulate a professional development environment.

<br>
<h2> Artificial Intelligence </h2>
I’ve taken an introductory AI course, where I applied my knowledge by developing a simple game in Python, which gave me insights into the fascinating world of AI.

<br>
<h2> Version Control and Collaboration </h2>
I am proficient in Git and have been practicing version control in various personal and academic projects, ensuring proper project management and collaboration.

<br>
<h2> Programming Languages </h2>
I have worked with a wide range of programming languages, including:
Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, R, Erlang, Scala and Prolog.

<br>
<h2> Cybersecurity </h2>
The introductory cybersecurity course provided me with a solid foundation in core cybersecurity principles, covering essential topics such as threat identification, risk assessment, and security best practices. I learned about common vulnerabilities, basic cryptography, network security protocols, and strategies for protecting sensitive information against unauthorized access. This course also emphasized the importance of proactive security measures and helped me build an understanding of the evolving landscape of cyber threats.
