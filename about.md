<h1> Who Am I? </h1>

My name is Vitalii Radzividlo, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Saskatchewan with a degree in Computer Science. Born in Ukraine, I moved to Canada where I completed my later school years and found a passion for technology, leading me to pursue studies in computer science.

Initially, I started with a major in Anatomy and Cell Biology but felt drawn to the problem-solving and creativity inherent in programming. One introductory course was enough to change my focus entirely, leading to a rewarding journey through the world of tech. In addition to my major, I pursued a minor in Biology, fascinated by the parallels between biological and computational systems.

My approach to growth is incremental; I strive to improve by at least 1% every day. I believe every experience—especially the challenges and setbacks—has value, shaping who we are and helping us grow if approached with resilience and curiosity.

In my spare time, I’m passionate about music, playing guitar and piano, and staying active with sports like volleyball and snowboarding. I’m also an avid reader (my latest recommendation is Atomic Habits by James Clear) and enjoy gaming as a way to unwind and explore different worlds.
